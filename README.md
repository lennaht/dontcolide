**UNDER CONSTRUCION**


This is my first JavaScript based game. It's very simple.

It's made on an HTML5 canvas object. You play it against a friend together on the same keyboard.

Player1 controls his line with WASD, Player2 with the arrow keys. The goal is to let your opponent crash into your line and avoid hitting your opponent's line.

You also die if you hit your own line or the border.
